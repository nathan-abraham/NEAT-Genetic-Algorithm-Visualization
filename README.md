# About
AI learns to play the chrome dinosaur game using NEAT (Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies)
Uses a feed-forward neural network with 4 inputs and two outputs to decide whether the dinosaur should jump over an obstacle, duck under an obstacle, or do nothing.

# Dependencies Information
Requirements: python 3.6 or higher, neat-python, pygame, numpy, graphviz, and matplotlib (the last three are only needed for visualizations)
These requirements can be installed using "pip install -r requirements.txt" (without quotation marks) in the terminal or virtual environment
